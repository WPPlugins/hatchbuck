== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I embed form shortcode into my template file? =

Please use `do_shortcode()` function. For example: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[hatchbuck form="HTML-form"]'); ?>`

= Where do I find Hatchbuck API keys? =

Go to Account Settings > Data > API to get API key.
Go to Account Settings > Data > API > Tags to get a specific tag key.

= Will Hatchbuck track scroll box subscribers? =

At this point no. Hatchbuck API does not allow to set a tracking cookie, so we can't track visitors that completed scroll box form. The moment Hatchbuck allows cookie to be set in API, we'll add that functionality.

**Tip:** Add an email confirmation for scroll box subscribers, asking them to click on a link in your email to confirm subscription. When they click that link, Hatchbuck will begin tracking them.

Please visit "Support" tab above to request help on WordPress.org forums. We try to respond in a timely fashion.
